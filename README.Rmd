# Recreating McKell Institute's super-wages model

This repo attempts to recreate the McKell Institute's super-wages model presented in their 2019 research paper [_'Does higher superannuation reduce workersâ€™ wages?'_](https://mckellinstitute.org.au/app/uploads/Does-higher-superannuation-reduce-wages.pdf). 

It uses the statistical package R and publicly-available data. Three R scripts are used in order:

1. `01_get_data.R`:  
2. `02_prepare_data.R`: 
3. `03_run_regressions.R`: 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
source("R/01_get_data.R")
source("R/02_prepare_data.R")
source("R/03_run_regressions.R")
```

They compile relevant data and produce tables of regression results for four model specifications.
